# Custom-Numpy
This project is both a C project as well as a performance projectâ€”building a slower version of numpy called numc is much faster than the naive implementations of matrix operations (but slower than the actual numpy). The Python-C interface is overloaded with some operators and defined some instance methods for numc.Matrix objects. Finally, the speed up the naive solution makes numc.Matrix operations faster.
